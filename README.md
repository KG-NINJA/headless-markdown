# Headless Markdown

**Headless Markdown** is a perception-first logging system.

It watches the world quietly,  
and writes Markdown **only when the world becomes still**.

No UI.  
No AI.  
No continuous narration.

Just perception → stability → memory.

## What this is

Headless Markdown turns a webcam into a **headless observer**.

- Detects visual change (classical CV, no AI)
- Waits until the scene becomes stable
- Runs OCR **only at that moment**
- Appends the result to a Markdown file

The output is not a log file.  
It is **a readable, structured memory of events**.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is the perfect intermediate representation.

- Human-readable
- Agent-readable
- Diff-friendly
- Git-friendly
- Obsidian-friendly

Headless Markdown does not render anything.  
It only **writes memory**.

## Core idea

> Do not understand the world continuously.  
> Record the world **only when it stops moving**.

This dramatically reduces noise and preserves meaning.
